The SDK key ensures that only authorized applications can access your feature flag data. The key is generated by Pioneer and can be accessed under the 'Account' menu of the GUI.

The SDK key needs to be included in your application code. When the pioneer SDK in your application attempts to connect with Pioneer, the key in your application will be compared with the SDK key stored in the Pioneer database. If the keys match, a successful connection between your application and Pioneer is established and feature flag data is sent. If authorization of the SDK fails then no data will be sent. 

If you suspect your SDK key has been comprised then a new one can be generated in the GUI. Ensure the SDK key in your application code is also updated. 

Further information on inputting the key into your SDK can be found [here](/sdk-intro.md).
