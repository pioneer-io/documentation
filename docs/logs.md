# Event Logs
A full history of all flag events can be viewed in the event log. The logs can be filtered by clicking on one of the items in the outlined menu bar.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={require('./assets/logs.gif').default} alt='Screenshot of Pioneer UI dashboard' />
</div>

The logs are a useful tool for tracing the activity of your feature flags. You can see what flags have been created, when they were toggled on or off, when they were updated and how, or even when they were deleted.

If there is ever a concern about how or when a flag was interacted with, you can find it here in the logs!
