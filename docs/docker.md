**Docker network diagram**

The Pioneer application is a Docker network running individual Docker containers. By default, one Docker container is run per Pioneer component; however, each of the containers are available as individual images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ljdavies/pioneer), enabling you to scale components as required.
