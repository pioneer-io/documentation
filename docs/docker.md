**Docker network diagram**

The Pioneer application is run as a Docker network. By default, one Docker container is run per Pioneer component; however, each of the containers are available as individual images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ljdavies/pioneer), enabling you to scale components as required.

Additionally, the Scout and Compass components are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/pioneer-io).
