title: Percentage rollout
---

Pioneer provides the option to specify which percentage of your users will receive the feature flag. The default value is 0%, meaning no users will receive the feature flag. 

Rolling out a new microservice to an increasing number of users enables you to test the microservice under different load conditions and only expose a subset of users to a potentially sub-standard user experience, if any issues occur. 

In order to utilise the percentage rollout strategy, an unique identifier (such as a session cookie) is required to identify individual users.

The identifier is passed into the SDK in your application code and the SDK will determine whether or not that particular user will receive the feature flag.
