title: Environment Variables
---
The Pioneer application comes with an `.env` [file](https://github.com/pioneer-io/pioneer/blob/main/.env) that provides default values for ports and postgreSQL configs. This enables the application to be run without any configuration. If you wish to configure any environment variables, then this file can be modified accordingly.
